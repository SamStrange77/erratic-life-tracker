                Disclaimer: This is all based on estimates AND SUBJECT TO CHANGE, I've split it into sections and given the wildcards more weight since they are the majority of the work involved. Still, I doubt this is *too* accurate, it should give you a decent idea of where we're at, though.<br><br>
                (For example, the number of wildcards might change, but we'll see)<br><br>
                (PS. Yes I spent like 2 hours making this. Yes I could have used that time to make Erratic Life. No regrets)
